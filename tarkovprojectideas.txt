IDEAS:

- add a way to look for ammo that goes over a certain penetration threshold
- (DONE) search hideout station by locales instead of ID

- for all:
	* show possible results to choose from
		- (DONE)for example (maps): Customs, Interchange, Reserve etc... and then you can type the map
		- (DONE)for example (ammo): 5.56x45, 5.45, 7.62x39___ DONE
		- for example (hideout): generator, security, heating etc...
