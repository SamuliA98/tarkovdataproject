IDEAS:

- (DONE) writing new information on calibers that class them to low, mid or high tier ammo.

- add another question after asking which caliber: low, mid, or high tier ammo? 

- (DONE) search hideout station by locales instead of ID

- for all:
	* show possible results to choose from
		- (DONE)for example (maps): Customs, Interchange, Reserve etc... and then you can type the map
		- (DONE)for example (ammo): 5.56x45, 5.45, 7.62x39___ DONE
		- (DONE)for example (hideout): generator, security, heating etc...

- weapon exploration
	* search default version weapons (done)
	* when having a weapon, it shows all the parts in it (hopping between item_presets and items?)

- clean up ammo data (remove non-needed info)
